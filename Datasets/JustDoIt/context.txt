Nike just announced its partnership with Colin Kaepernick to be the face of the 30th anniversary of its JustDoIt campaign.
They used the slogan "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything."
Kaepernick had made a controversial decision not to stand up during the national anthem, as a protest to police brutality, a while back.
This has stirred a heated debate, and became a big national issue especially when Donald Trump commented on it.
