Coachella sucks. I can see Drake and AC/DC anytime they tour. Yawn#Coachella #Coachella2015


#Coachella2015 line up less than impressive, but still stoked for dartying in the sun to Alesso

I wish #incubus or #sonsofthesea would have been on the #Coachella2015 lineup


Who designs the #Coachella2015 posters?Get a head ache as soon as I look at it.


Not excited that mainstream hip hop/R&amp;B artists are headlining hippie #Coachella2015 but already got my tix.Finna get in my feelings @drake

AC/DC?  Cool.  I'm still not going.  :)   #Coachella2015 http://t.co/bvViTZRu94


@VitaliyP Very recycled lineup this year, though. Many of the same bands that have played the big three the last two years. #Coachella2015


@lisa_TTRO @coachella not as excited with the lineup this year. It's still good though #Coachella2015


ACDC, bad religion, and jack white at #Coachella2015 ... Is this KROQ's weenie roast circa 2000? No thank you.


The people that spend $5k on a weekend festival are nuuuts. And loaded. #Coachella2015


Coachella line up this year is so weak . #Coachella2015

Saw #Coachella2015 line up and honestly... this is the first year that I'm not pressed to go.


If I wanted to hear AC DC and a whole lot of metallic noise I'd go to Jiffy Lube and save a few thousand dollars#Coachella2015


#Coachella2015 lineup is trash to be honest... I would only want to see the weeknd but other than that not spending my money on it

RT @ANDREW0675: have to say am not overly impressed with this years #Coachella2015 line up


Coachella lineup is very disappointing this year. No Hall and Oates? No Phil Collins? No @patjordanband ? #dontyoueversay #Coachella2015


Official lineup... This one is a little better still not that impressed #Coachella2015 http://t.co/m0JPb7Fhp2


Why the fuck is AC/DC headlining #Coachella2015? What year is this?

AC/DC as a headliner for #Coachella2015? I'm at a loss for words. It USED to be such a rad music fest. What happened?  :(


I just wanna know why it's necessary for AC/DC to be at #Coachella2015


#Coachella2015 lineup is unbelievably weak.


#Coachella2015 line up is weak , a couple good acts here and there butttt for the most part wack ! Pass.
