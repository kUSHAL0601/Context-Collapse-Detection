Coachella's delivered a late Christmas present to everyone: the announcement of this year's festival lineup. AC/DC, Jack White and Drake top this year's bill, which is rounded out by a typically Coachellian mix of big names (Tame Impala, Steely Dan, Azaelia Banks, the Weeknd, Florence and the Machine) and welcome surprises (Sylvan Esso, Raekwon and Ghostface Killa, Chet Faker, the War on Drugs).
