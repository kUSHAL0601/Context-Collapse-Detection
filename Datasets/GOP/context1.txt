GOP debate 2015. Donald trump has lit up the early GOP primary with his trash-talking approach to politics, and he certainly didn't pull any punches during Thursday's debate, which was hosted in Cleveland, Ohio by Fox News. He tossed some barbs at other candidates, at President Obama, even at Rosie O'Donnell - and he received a few in return. But his combative style didn't dominate the evening. Instead, most of the other candidates focused on burnishing their own strengths and carving out their own brands within a winnowed-but-still-crowded lineup. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush positioned himself as a sober problem-solver, vowing not to use "wedge issues" like immigration and education to score cheap political points. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz did not relent in his war on the GOP establishment, reminding voters about his scuffles with Republican Senate leaders who "don't honor their commitments."Florida Sen. Marco Rubio promised to be the voice of the new generation and warned his party that Hillary Clinton will win the election if the campaign is boiled down to a "resume competition." Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul reminded the audience of his fight against government surveillance, drawing fierce pushback from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who recalled his personal exposure to the September 11 terror attacks. Ohio Gov. John Kasich played to the hometown crowd with an enthusiastic performance that was suffused with references to his faith.
